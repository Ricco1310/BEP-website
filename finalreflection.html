                The insights about prototyping I have gained have helped me tremendously in other projects and as such I could see the immideate
                fruit of my labor. I have used lo-fi wireframes to quickly iterate and design my visual designs for ID2,
                I have used the skills learned during week 7 and 8 for the PDE video and I have learned the general principles
                behind prototyping. Key insights that I have learned are the simplicity of rapid prototyping, how to make
                prototypes understandable and how to interview and understand people's opinions of my prototypes. Lastly
                I have also swapped to a new toolset that enhances my prototypes even further because of this course, seeing
                as I was hampered by Marvel. I swapped to Invision, for its simplicity, and Axure, for its robustness. This
                all in all has allowed me to make a better user experience during my prototyping. Which in turn makes my
                final user experience many times better.
