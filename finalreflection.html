                In hindsight I can say a lot of praising things about the Building Engaging Prototyping course.
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly in the first week we experimented with lo-fi paper prototypes, but with a twist. We had to design a music player
                application for mobile and for watch. During this week I bettered my quick and dirty prototyping skills,
                which I can use in the future to make quick sketches to show my idea to a client. Obviously they are not
                self-explanatory without some knowledge about the subject, but they can serve as a very handy force multiplier
                during explanations. The prototypes which I created during this week are simple and clear to the user. A
                few key features where missing, such as a pocket library for the watch, and as such I created these. Early
                prototyping would have allowed me in this case to quickly iterate through some designs without sacrificing
                to much time.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the second week we work on a non-visual type of design prototyping. We had to come up and design a gesture controlled
                system that gave us audio feedback. Now our question was, how are we going to prototype these? To me this
                week was more of a gimmick that did manage to drive a point back home. Namely that having to think about
                more unorthodox prototyping methods to create and test my prototypes. In the end, having received aid from
                the teacher, I managed to get sound files from an online, free to use sound library and recorded these together
                with my motions. The feedback gained on these resulted for in some new sound files to replace a few wonky
                ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                During week three we worked on non-interactive hi-fi prototypes which had to show a proper user flow and lay-out. Our assignment
                was to work on an application for a travel planning company called Tripp3r. We received a list of requirements
                which we had to work with, for me this means that I have to come up with solutions first. For this reason
                I made a morphological chart to come up with potential solutions to create a better user experience for my
                user. I would as such say that I managed to do this very well, since my feedback was little and short. But
                the small things which I forgot I will take with me to the next designs in the future. The proper wireframing
                I honed here is a good tool for initial designs, especially with the tools which I use nowadays, since they
                support the quick creation of wireframes via drag and drop.
            </p>
            <p>
                In week four we had to convert our wireframes from the previous week to full-fledged designs that are fully interactive to
                such a degree that all proper features are present and clickable. Back then I used inVision for its simplicity
                and free to use nature. Since then however, I swapped to Axure RP, which allows me to make more complete
                interactive designs, due to the larger tool suite it has. This new tool allows me to make more advanced prototypes
                quicker, which in turn allows for a quicker design cycle in which I can show advanced phases of my design.
                A few key feedback points were given by my reviewer, but some of these came more down to designs philosophy
                than proper design. I did however, see what he meant by them and could use this feedback to increase user
                flow and interactivity with the platform. Allowing for a better user experience.
            </p>

                Week five and six consisted of explanatory prototyping. During these two weeks we had to come up with a user experience related
                question, set up a test environment and test and record the results of this test. For me this consisted of
                wanting to test the delay the fold in a page creates when looking though a list of items. For this I created
                two version of a long list of words and asked them to find stop in this list. The results of this were logged
                in an Excel file to check later. Whilst the User Experience is not really present in this design, since I
                am only interested in one aspect off it. I did still keep some of it mind to make the assignment as intuitive
                as possible. Using this method I was able to confirm my hypothesis to some degree and can see this same tool
                working in the future when you have something you want tested.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the last two weeks we worked on experience prototyping. We had to develop a balance related game, for this we had
                various tools at our disposal. I created a game in processing which was to be controlled in a wizard of Oz
                related way. If more finetuned I can see this tool being really handy for prototyping physical products,
                digital ones less so however. But for that reason there is a prototyping tool for every problem. In the end
                we had a fairly complete game, yet it was still riddled with bugs. The User Experience was borderline useless,
                since the goal was time oriented, the user just ignored basically everything to get his goal as soon as possible.
                Therefore I would have created a new game that requires more thoughts, as to force the user to look at the
                game in more detail. In the end however, I can say that this tool is a very handy tool to use to figure out
                how a user would use your product.
            </p>

                All in all I can state again that this course, Building Engaging prototypes, was one of the best and most handy subject which
                I had during the year. As such I would suggest to move the subject up to period two, or if slightly adjusted
                to period one. This because of the sheer usefulness that is the skills learned during this course. Most useful
                of this course was the mixed lecture and workshop classes, which motivated me to actually work on assignments,
                but didnâ€™t leave me in the cold as what to do, since ample explanation was provided. This is also THE reason
                why this subject would do good early on in the program.
