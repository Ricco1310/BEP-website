                The contents of this week
            </h1>
            <p>
                For week 2 we trialed with non-visual interfaces, in which we had to make audio-motion interface for the music application
                as designed last week. Where motion was what the user used as input, and the system outputted sounds for
                confirmation and feedback.

                Initial Design
            </h1>
            <p>
                I started by searching for sounds that fitted the tasks that the user could be performing, as such each action has its own
                sound, logically explained with each sound underneath. An extra motion and counter-motion that I added are
                lock and unlock respectively, each with their own sound. This sound was added so that the user can lock and
                unlock the motion detection as to not accidentally send commands until unlocked. Many of the motions are
                based on flexing the muscles in a certain way, together with a corresponding motion. Which most modern day
                smart watches support.

                Feedback
            </h1>
            <p>
                The feedback for this week was nigh non-existent. Both of the students I asked told me the same thing, all sounds and motions
                are good, with one exception, the lock/unlock sound. Therefore I tweaked the sound to be more distinct.

                Reflection
            </h1>
            <p>
                This week was quite interesting, as I had never worked this much with non-visual interfaces. In the end however, I would
                say that I gathered the insights required to successfully use this technology in the future.
