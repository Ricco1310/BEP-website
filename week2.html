                The contents of this week
            </h1>
            <p>
                For week 2 we trialed with non-visual interfaces, in which we had to make audio-motion interface for the music application
                as designed last week. Where motion was what the user used as input, and the system outputted sounds for
                confirmation and feedback.

                Initial Design
            </h1>
            <p>
                I started by searching for sounds that fitted the tasks that the user could be performing, as such each action has its own
                sound, logically explained with each sound underneath. An extra motion and counter-motion that I added are
                lock and unlock respectively, each with their own sound. This sound was added so that the user can lock and
                unlock the motion detection as to not accidentally send commands until unlocked. Many of the motions are
                based on flexing the muscles in a certain way, together with a corresponding motion. Which most modern day
                smart watches support.

                Feedback
            </h1>
            <p>
                The feedback for this week was nigh non-existent. Both of the students I asked told me the same thing, all sounds and motions
                are good, with two exception, the lock/unlock sound being the same and the repeat sound being to short for
                the gesture used. Therefore I tweaked the sounds to be more distinct. The new sound for the lock/unlock has
                already been implemented in the video above and the activate sound. Below you can find the original, which
                now is the unlock sound, and the new repeat sound.

                Sounds
            </h1>
            <p>
                The first audio file is the lock sound, as you can hear, audibly different. The second sound is the new loop sound, which
                is longer and contains more audible clicks in the actual sound file to make it easier for the user to hear
                and understand.

                Reflection
            </h1>
            <p>
                This week was quite interesting, as I had never worked this much with non-visual interfaces. In the end however, I would
                say that I gathered the insights required to successfully use this technology in the future. Another factor
                that I noticed was that my fellow students didn't really know what kind of feedback to give, since the audio-motion
                method is quite uncommon.
