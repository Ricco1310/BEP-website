                The contents of this week
            </h1>
            <p>
                For week 5 and 6 we focused on exploratory prototyping. For these two weeks we had to come up with a test that confirms or
                denies a query about visuals on a page. I decided to use the fold and hand code the page for best results.

                Initial Design
            </h1>
            <p>
                My prototype consists of two similar lists with words in them, the user is asked to click the start and find the word stop,
                once the user clicks start a timer starts running, and this one ends when the user clicks stop. The results
                of this timer I have logged in the a excel sheet as can be seen in the results. Reflection on the results
                can be found under reflection. The page was created in this way to eliminate potential external factors.

            </h1>
            <p>
                The user will take around twice as long to find items below the fold.

                    and the user can start he timer by starting.
