                The contents of this week
            </h1>
            <p>
                For week 5 and 6 we focused on exploratory prototyping. For these two weeks we had to come up with a test that confirms or
                denies a query about visuals on a page. I decided to use the fold and hand code the page for best results.

                Initial Design & Test Setup
            </h1>
            <p>
                My prototype consists of two similar lists with words in them, the user is asked to click the start and find the word stop,
                once the user clicks start a timer starts running, and this one ends when the user clicks stop. The results
                of this timer I have logged in the a excel sheet as can be seen in the results. Reflection on the results
                can be found under reflection. The page was created in this way to eliminate potential external factors.

            <p>
                The user will take around twice as long to find items below the fold.

            </h1>
            <p>
                The conclusion that can be drawn from this short research is that items below the fold will take longer to be found than
                items above the fold. As such the placement of important items above the fold is key.

                Reflection
            </h1>
            <p>
                This week was quite different from the previous 4 weeks, as it allowed me to produce higher quality content and make better
                use of it. A few surprises for me where the relative accuracy of my prediction, as it was a wild estimate.
                Secondly the results were interesting, especially the overshoots, as I completely forgot about their existence
                before the tests were ran. Lastly would be the relative ease that a exploratory prototype allows me to have
                with regards to testing and prototyping.
