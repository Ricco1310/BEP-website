                The contents of this week
            </h1>
            <p>
                In week 1 we worked on low fidelity paper prototyping. The assignment was to create a low fidelity paper prototype for a
                two devices, a phone and a smart watch.

                Initial Design
            </h1>
            <p>
                For my initial design I used the windows music player and design patterns as prim inspiration. What this entails is that
                the interfaces are very minimalistic and clearly separate its content. It also entails is that I used the
                carousel menu for inspiration, with one clear difference in that it already clearly shows what you will be
                navigating to. Furthermore with the carousel the user can see where in the menu he is. The smart watch screen
                works on similar principles. However the menu carousel doesn’t contain a preview, as that would consume to
                much space.

                        This will be the first screen the user is presented with. Through showing his most recently played music he or she can easily
                        continue where he or she left of.

                        Through this screen, which the user can go to by swiping left, he or she has full access to his or her music library. Multiple

                        This is what one of the filtering options screens available to the user would look like. Depending on the filter applied,
                        it will show the relevant data for that song such as artist and genre.

                        Once the user has decided and selected a song, this screen will appear. The user has full control over the song and can adjust
                        the settings to his or her wishes. The rest of the menu is still reachable through swiping.

                        For the smart watch many of the same elements are still present. The compacted grid view allows for more screen however by
                        nesting elements of the application.

                Feedback
            </h1>
            <p>
                Most of the design was received fairly positively, as it being clear and all-encompassing. A few key elements of criticism
                were as follows. For non-windows phone users, the menu carousel made little to no sense and was difficult
                to navigate. Furthermore the smart watch application was lacking a library that the user could select his
                music from. I explained it as being connected to the phone, but this was countered with the question “Why
                would I even use the smart watch then?” To which I had no answers. This feedback resulted in 3 new screens,
                1 for smartphone/smart watch and 2 for smart watch exclusively. The smartphone/smart watch screen contains
                a new menu the user can use for navigating the application, it contains module tabs, which still present
                the location in the app. The 2 smart watch screens allow the user to select a song or album from a playlist.
                This is achieved by having multiple layers, firstly the user selects what to search for and then selects
                from that selection.

                    <figcaption>
                        After the feedback it became clear that the average user was not user to the kind of menu I was using and am used to. As
                        such I recreated it into a tab-based menu.

                    <figcaption>
                        It became apparent that the user was not interested by only using forward and backward, along with recent, as such I created
                        a menu that is grid-based.

                Reflection
            </h1>
            <p>
                The insights I have gathered from this week are a multitude. Firstly, existing patterns, if unfamiliar, are not clear to
                the user, as such target group analysis is a must. Secondly, quick and dirty paper prototypes allow for quick
                iteration and are fairly forgiving. Therefore these paper prototypes can be used to test and verify early
                findings, or for brainstorming.
