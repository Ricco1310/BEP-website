            </h1>
            <p>
                For week 3 we started on wireframing for high fidelity prototypes, for this we are going to make a trip planner application
                called tripper. For this week we focus solely on the content and lay-out if the application, as set forth
                from the requirements given to us.

                Initial Design
            </h1>
            <p>
                For my initial design I decided to go with a web interface, because it is common and standard. The applicationâ€™s design is
                one of simplicity and minimalism, seeing as the user does not want to be showered with information. Due to
                this the design has ample place for the logo for branding, has four distinct fields people have to fill out
                and has more options hidden under a collapsible panel at the bottom. For finishing touches I added a menu
                and search bar as required.
