                The contents of this week
            </h1>
            <p>
                For week 3 we started on wireframing for high fidelity prototypes, for this we are going to make a trip planner application
                called tripper. For this week we focus solely on the content and lay-out if the application, as set forth
                from the requirements given to us.

            <h1>
                Initial Design
            </h1>
            <p>
                For my initial design I decided to go with a web interface, because it is common and standard. The applicationâ€™s design is
                one of simplicity and minimalism, seeing as the user does not want to be showered with information. Due to
                this the design has ample place for the logo for branding, has four distinct fields people have to fill out
                and has more options hidden under a collapsible panel at the bottom. For finishing touches I added a menu
                and search bar as required. Below you can see a table for my thought process
            </p>
            <table>

            <p>
                The feedback put forth on my wireframes is one of (mostly) utility. Key errors were: Clarity, flow and feedback. From this
                I can conclude that I need to make sure that the entire page is understood at a glance, secondly I need to
                make sure that the options provided are clear enough for the user to understand what they do and thirdly
                I need to make sure that the actions the user performs are reflected back by the page with a proper state
                and order to them. The original PDF can he downloaded <a href="images\week3\Evaluation-by-rick-for-riccardo.pdf"

            <p>
                The table up above was a very handy tool for creating the wireframes, as I could get get key insights on how to design the
                page. As such many of the elements found on the page can be seen in the table somewhere. It also looks like
                a few key features that I thought were standard and useful, were less so. The more options element is confusing
                for some people since it only shows transport options. Because of this is also doesn't clearly present itself
                as a navigation application, which is something that is very important.
