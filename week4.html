            </h1>
            <p>
                For this week we are continuing the design and creation of high fidelity prototypes, this time we are starting with visual designs for the tripper application we started with last week. Our requirement was to create visual designs based upon the visual identity (the logo) of the company and the wireframes created last week.

                Initial Design
            </h1>
            <p>
                For my design I decided to go with a cyan background, as it is an extension of the blue colour used in the logo and because it is very soothing on the eyes. The input boxes stay black and white to maintain clarity and make them visually distinct enough. Interactive elements such as the menu and more options are green as this colour can be used on a cyan background, and it does conform to the logo. Lastly the search box has a yellow background, as it is a call to action is must be visually distinct enough. The trip page follows a similar colour scheme for the same reasons.
