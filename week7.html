            <p>
                For week 7 and 8 we worked on experience prototyping during which we created a Wizard of Oz prototype. Using this we could
                test a balancing related game.

                Initial Design
            </h1>
            <p>
                For our initial design we decided to use stepping stones to simulate the floor is lava. For this we used processing for its
                ease of use for animation. For our the floor is lava game we decided to base it on the stepping stones sinking
                into the lava. To complete the trail the user would have to stay on all of the stepping stones, but no longer
                then a few seconds.

                        This is the first screen projected onto the floor, it contains all stepping stones as black squares that we can overlay.
                        Furthermore a clock keeps track of the time passed.

                        This screen had the lava background removed for better legibility. As such it was easier for the user to spot the stones.
